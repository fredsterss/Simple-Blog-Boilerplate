# How we hire

We hired our second engineer and are hiring a third. Here is how we hire.

I believe we interview people in a pretty unique way and with good reason. We see a startups first few engineering hires as being critical; both culturally and technically; they affect the morale of the founders as well as existing staff and clients. They shape your company.

So, we do them as best we can. The process has four stages and is as follows.

## Find qualified leads
For us these count as;
- Friends
- Recommendations from our investors staffing departments
- Hacker News

For us the first one is pretty hard; we're two English guys living in San Francisco. Our friends are all already working at other startups, or living back in the UK. It's much easier if you have a local (US?) network to draw upon, we don't.

Note; We normally weight positive recommendations of people from friends in similar stage startups lowly, but don't totally discount them. This is because if the person was truly good, they'd probably hire them themselves.

Negative feedback about people from friends we've learnt (the hard way) not to ignore; they're weighted highly.

## Get in touch 
Normally first contact is via email - we ask for Github usernames (or equivalent) and any thing else that might be relevant.

We love to see interesting projects that people have worked on and contributed to especially - it lets us look through actual work commit by commit and get a feel of the general standard of coding.

Empty Github accounts or no samples of work are usually a bad sign from experience.

## Filter the leads
Next Fred, my co-founder and the CEO, phone interviews everyone. This is usually a 20 minute to hour long call and covers everything from what we and the person are doing, beliefs about the idea, to social aspects.

If Fred thinks they're interesting and might be a good fit, I arrange a follow up call; more technical but limited to 15-20 minutes. I'm looking for some history of their programming, details about interesting problems they've solved and a feel of what type of programmer they'd be.

## The 'interview'
Our in person interviews are different to normal.

The outward aim of the interview is to do a half day to day long hack - with several rules:

- It can be nothing to do with our product
- Must be on Github and MIT Licensed
- Must be shipped by the end of the interview
- Uses an unfamiliar language or framework

The day usually starts with food and throwing around ideas about what to hack on; we keep a list, but ask the person a few days before if they have anything they'd like to hack on as well.

After that, it's back to the office to hash out the details and start coding.

The whole process gives us great insight in to how people think and work - here is why;

### It can be nothing to do with our product
This avoids a couple of things; strong existing views from us and IP issues.

### Must be on Github and MIT Licensed
This seems fair to all!

### Must be shipped by the end of the interview
This adds a sense of pressure, but also helps us narrow the scope of what we build, showing up judgement and estimation skills.

If the project takes longer than expected, it also indicates a level of willingness to persevere; from both our side and the persons.

After the interview, we think about:

- Were we led astray?
- Did we lead them down the wrong track without complaint?
- If we had to, did we want to work late with this person?
- If they had to, did they feel like they want to work late with us?
- Did they care about shipping stuff to a deadline?

### Uses an unfamiliar language or framework
We don't always stick to this one - mainly when the chosen hack is an extension to something existing.

The aim of this is to see how the person learns, thinks and how clearly they explain things unfamiliar to us.

This has turned out to be a great one for seen how people (including us) handle the unknown
