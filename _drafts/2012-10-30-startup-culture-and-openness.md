# Startup culture, and two bits of advice for new entrepreneurs
Startups are _not_ real life. As in, the normal rules of business, the conventions of career advancement, and the definitions of success do not apply to startups.

Two things at the Seedhack hackathon launch last night made me think about this.

First, I asked someone who I was chatting to what he did. He ummed and ahhed, went a bit red in the face and then admitted, conspiratorally, "I'm unemployed".

Second, a known 'shark' - a pretend investor who tricks naive startups into giving him equity in return for his __time__ - managed to slip into the event, and started soliciting pitches from our various teams.

## What?
These two events are entirely connected. The beauty of the startup world is that noone cares who you are. Noone cares the colour of your skin, what university you went to - if any - or who you work(ed) for. You are allowed to be who you want to be, and that has both positive and negative effects. One of the first things that any new entrepreneur must embrace, in my opinion, is this inquisitive culture of openness.

In the first case, our unemployed friend just needed a bit of gentle coaching. Just as many people have done to me when I tell them my first startup failed, I congratulated him. I think anyone who has experienced that flush of adrenaline from the moment of realisation that - through choice or circumstance - your destiny is now entirely in your hands, can relate. He was actually working on a number of projects, seeking co-founders, and reclaiming his life and creativity after several years of post-university management 'consultancy'.

This is one of the best corollaries of startup culture. Years of startup homeruns have created a generation that has internalised everyone's potential, hidden or otherwise. Often my friends in more traditional careers think I'm crazy, that my life is far too easy, that I get to do what I love and get rewarded for it. They see what we do as incompatible with the system - in England we call it the 'rat-race' - with which people conduct their working lives. I feel like the realisation that this system is just a mental construct is the single most crucial step towards becoming an entrepreneur, and by extension, taking control of your 'career'. I encourage everyone, entrepreneur or not, to try and look at life in this way.

The second case, of our predatory 'mentor', is a bit more troubling. Unfortunately, the startup culture creates room for people like him. In traditional business, he wouldn't even have been in the room. His CV would have been analysed, his credentials checked, and his claims exposed as bullshit. Our culture of openness and trust creates space for people like him. 

These situations always make me uneasy, because I realise that my vulnerability stems from the very principles I must embrace in order to succeed.
