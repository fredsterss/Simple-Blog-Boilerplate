There are many posts written about securing your web application, avoiding SQL attacks, cross site scripting and other attacks. Little has been written for web developers about securing the infrastructure that runs web applications.

- Never trust the user: why trust random internet people?
- Firewalls
- Bad defaults; accounts, settings
- SSH keys
